# Hi, I'm Jack Felke 👋

I'm a **Professional AI Engineer & Developer** at All Digital Rewards, building innovative, commercial-grade projects and open source tools that push the envelope in AI and full-stack development.

## About Me

I believe in continuous improvement both personally and professionally. Inspired by the habit stacking method from *Atomic Habits* by James Clear, I design bulletproof routines that include breathwork, cardio, and walks with Stella.

In 2026, I'm accelerating my focus on **AI infrastructure**, **MCP (Model Context Protocol) development**, and next-generation developer tools. I've been shipping innovative projects that enhance Claude's capabilities and exploring agentic trading systems while maintaining a healthy, balanced lifestyle.
