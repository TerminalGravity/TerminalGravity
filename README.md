# Hi, I'm Jack Felke ðŸ‘‹  
### I'm a Professional AI Engineer & Developer

I'm Jack Felkeâ€” AI Engineer at All Digital Rewards. I build innovative, commercial-grade projects and open source tools that push the envelope in AI and full-stack development. I'm not just an enthusiast; I work professionally on solutions that scale.

## About Me

I believe in continuous improvement both personally and professionally. Inspired by the habit stacking method from *Atomic Habits* by James Clear, I design bulletproof routines that include breathwork, cardio, and walks with Stella. I'm proud of my current 42-day streak on Duolingo as I work on mastering both Chinese and French.

In 2025, I'm ready to launch several new projects and tackle fresh challenges at work. Iâ€™m excited about evolving my skills in modern web frameworks, containerization, and AI engineering while maintaining a healthy, balanced lifestyle.

## My Goals for 2025

### Personal Goals
- **Optimize My Productivity:** I will continue using the habit stacking method to design routines that keep me focused and energizedâ€”integrating breathwork, cardio, and regular walks.
- **Language Mastery:** I plan to extend my Duolingo streak as I master Chinese and French.
- **Sustainable Living:** I aim to build a sustainable, bulletproof routine that fuels my creativity and overall well-being.

### Personal-Professional Goals
- **Project Launches:**
  - **Hearthful App:** I'm developing an AI-powered event planning tool for large groups and family gatherings.
  - **Diagram Canvas Project:** I'm excited about this Next.js-based clone of ChatGPT Canvas, which generates and renders diagrams using Excalidraw JSON and Mermaid.js.
    - **Tech Highlights:**
      - I built it using **LangGraph** to orchestrate agent workflows modeled as graphs.
      - My workflow uses shared states, functions (edges) to decide the next steps, and nodes that encapsulate the logic for the o3-mini and my fine-tuned 4o model agents.
      - The o3-mini agent works with the 4o model to refine the generated code. With this project, I can preview diagrams, edit them via natural language, upload images, copy code, and download diagrams as PNG.
    - > **Note:** I'll update this section with the latest details on finetuning, dataset generation, and workflow improvements.
  - aipartpicker
  - prompt engineering app for cursor, wep-app + companion vs-code extension: generate codebase vector stores on-device, store on cloud chat anywhere with multiple codebases + api & github integration on web for context aware prompt engineering
  - stuff using the realtime api: chrome extension, vs-code ... codebase coach voice agents help you when you're in the vibe code mood
  -  open source devtools and cli tooling 
  - youtube-ai-extension
- **Explore On-Device LLMs:** I think an interesting experiment would be to find a use case for a fine-tuned LLM that runs on my Android deviceâ€”using a distillation dataset and a very small student model (Phi:3b).
- learn UIKit and do a iOS, watchOS, macOS and visionOS apps with Swift
- AI Closet Stylist; learns your wardrobe and dresses you like royalty. 
    
### Professional Career Goals
- **Deepen My Expertise:** I plan to master SSR frameworksâ€”including Angular (with Material)â€”and further my skills in Node.js solutions.
- **Expand Containerization Skills:** I will continue working with Docker.
- **Enhance AI Pipelines:** Iâ€™m committed to advancing RAG pipelines through evaluations, callback tracing, guardrails, agentic improvements, embedding optimizations, and model tuning/distillation.
- **Master LangGraph:** By the end of Q1 2025, I aim to fully understand LangGraph so that I can confidently discuss its transformative impact on AI workflows.

Iâ€™m also watching the developments of DeepSeek R1, Kimi k1.5, optimization methods, and effective RL frameworks. Iâ€™ve found that fine-tuning and evaluations using these skills can vastly improve outputs. Additionally, Iâ€™m exploring model distillationâ€”generating high-quality training data by using a larger reasoning model (teacher) to fine-tune a target student model. This system benefits from enhanced reasoning tokens and chain of thought responses, and it leverages tools such as web data integrations and vector stores (as a knowledge base of text/images) to further optimize performance.

## My Projects & Initiatives

### Diagram Canvas Project (Upcoming)
I'm working on a clone of ChatGPT Canvas that generates and renders diagrams using Excalidraw JSON and Mermaid.js.  
- **Tech Highlights:**
  - I built this as a Next.js app powered by **LangGraph**, which models agent workflows as graphs.
  - I designed a workflow where:
    - **States** are shared data structures (Annotation objects) that capture the current snapshot.
    - **Edges** are functions that determine which node to execute next based on the current state.
    - **Nodes** encapsulate the logic for both the o3-mini and my fine-tuned 4o model agents.
  - The o3-mini works alongside the 4o model to refine the generated code. With this project, I can preview diagrams, edit them using natural language instructions, upload images, copy code, and download diagrams as PNG.
  
> **Note:** I'll update this section with the latest details on finetuning, dataset generation, and workflow improvements.

### Hearthful App (Prototype)
I'm developing an AI-powered event planning tool for large groups or family gatherings. I started prototyping this project in December, and I can't wait to see it come to life.

### Other Initiatives
I have half a dozen projects planned for 2025, blending commercial use cases with open source contributions that leverage my expertise in full-stack development and AI engineering.
